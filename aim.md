<b> To verify kirchhoff's voltage law.</b>

The aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the voltage in their respective branches.<br>

 <b>Objectives:- </b><br>

1.Analyze closed loops in a circuit to apply KVL, ensuring the sum of voltages is zero. <br>
2.To measure voltage in a circuit for each element.<br>
3.To verify Kirchoff's Voltage Law by comparing theoretically calculated values with the practical one.<br>
4.To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.


  <b>To verify kirchhoff's current law.</b><br>

The aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the current in their respective branches.  <br>

 <b> Objectives:- </b> <br>

1.Apply KCL to ensure the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it.<br>
2.To measure current in a circuit for each element.<br>
3.To verify Kirchoff's Current Law by comparing theoretically calculated values with the practical one.<br>
4.To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.
