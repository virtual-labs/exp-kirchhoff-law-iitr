### Steps to perform experiment
  
**STEP 1 : Make connections by dragging nodes from apparatus to the circuit.<br>    
&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; &nbsp;  (a) Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10). 
&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; &nbsp;  (b) Connect voltmeter (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any voltmeter to any resistance in circuit.
&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp; &nbsp;  (c) Click on the label to delete all the connections for the corresponding nodes.<br>
**STEP 2 : Check your connections by clicking on the ‘CHECK’ button. <br>
**STEP 3:  If the alert is ‘Invalid connections’ the experiment will reload automatically and repeat from step 1.<br>
**STEP 4:  If the alert is ‘Right connections’ follow the below steps.<br>
**STEP 5 : Set the values of resistances R1, R2 & R3 by adjusting the sliders, these values will remain constant throughout the experiment. <br>
**STEP 6 : Click the ‘Power’ button to turn on the power supply.  <br>
**STEP 7 : Now, vary the voltage value by adjusting the voltage slider, the readings on the voltmeter will change accordingly.  <br>
**STEP 8 : Click on the ‘ADD’ button to add the readings to the observation table. <br>
**STEP 9 : Repeat steps 5 and 6 until we reach to the 6th reading (Minimum reading to be taken to plot the graph is 6). <br>
**STEP 10 : Click on the ‘PLOT’ button to display the graph.  <br>
**STEP 11 : Click on ‘PRINT’ button to take out the print of the page.<br> 
**step 12 : Click on ‘RESET’ button to refresh the page.  <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  (a) Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10). 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  (b) Connect ammeters (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any ammeter to any resistance in circuit.
