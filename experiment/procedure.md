### Steps to perform experiment
<br>
  
**STEP 1 :** Make connections by dragging nodes from apparatus to the circuit.<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;**(a)** Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;**(b)** Connect voltmeter (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any voltmeter to any resistance in circuit.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;**(c)** Click on the label to delete all the connections for the corresponding nodes. <br><br>

**STEP 2 :** Check your connections by clicking on the <b>‘CHECK’</b>  button.<br><br>
**STEP 3 :** Set the values of resistances R1, R2 & R3 by adjusting the sliders on left, these values will remain constant throughout the experiment. <br><br>
**STEP 4 :** Click the <b>‘Power’</b> button to turn on the power supply.  <br><br>
**STEP 5 :** Now, vary the voltage value by moving the voltage slider to the right side, the readings on the voltmeter will change accordingly.  <br><br>
**STEP 6 :** Click on the <b>‘ADD’</b> button to add the readings to the observation table. <br><br>
**STEP 7 :** Repeat steps 6 and 7 until we reach to the 6th reading (Minimum reading to be taken to plot the graph is 6). <br><br>
**STEP 8 :** Click on the <b>‘PLOT’</b> button to display the graph.  <br><br>
**STEP 9 :** Click on <b>‘PRINT’</b> button to take out the print of the page.<br> <br>
**STEP 10 :** Click on <b>‘RESET’</b> button to refresh the page.  <br> <br>
