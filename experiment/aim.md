* To verify kirchhoff's voltage law.

The Aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the voltage in their respective branches.<br>

          Objectives:- 
          
          1.	To understand the Kirchhoff’s junction and loop in the electrical circuit.
          2.	To measure voltage in a circuit for each element.
          3.	To Verify Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law by comparing analytically calculated values with practical one.
          4.	To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.
